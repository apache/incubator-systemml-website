        <h3>Airport Traffic</h3>
        <p>With airports getting more and more congested, researchers used SystemML to predict passenger volumes at various airport locations. With a very large data set, researchers were able to create multiple models per location and per passenger time, while developing a time-series analysis on the change of seasons.</p>

        <h3>Social Banking</h3>
        <p>Researchers decided to look at social media data linked to bank data in order to identify customer segments of interest, find predictors of what people would want to purchase and gauge sentiment towards bank products. Using SystemML, they were able to do this using bivariate odds ratios and binomial proportions with confidence intervals.</p>
